# Concurrency

This project explores how to safely manage concurrency in .NET using [`ConcurrentDictionary`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentdictionary-2) and [`SemaphoreSlim`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.semaphoreslim). The main objective is to demonstrate how to handle multiple tasks running in parallel within an ASP.NET Web API, avoiding race conditions and ensuring safe access to shared resources.
